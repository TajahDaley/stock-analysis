# Stock Analysis
# Overview
The overview of this project was to help Steve and his parents take a closer look into some of the stocks for 2017 and 2018. Compiling the data and giving them an easier look into the stocks can give them a better look into where to invest. In my opinion They should look at more than just two years maybe a minimum of 5 years to get a better look at how the stocks flow. 
# purpose
The purpose was to take a look at the different stocks and look at how well they did in the years of 2017 and 2018. We took a close look at one of the Stocks (DQ) for the family and we cam to see that in the year 2018 it did not do well. Seeing this was a good idea to take a look at other stocks to see how well they did compared to (DQ).

As you can see from the image The retun on this stock was not great. 
# Comparing Stocks
When looking at the stocks there really were no trends. In this project we had to create a code so that we can see the return for all of the stocks with a click of a button. Allowing Steve and his family to press a button and type in the year they want so that they can see the return for each stock is amazing. The easiest difference to see here is it seems 2017 was a better year yielding a positive return for a lot of stocks but as we know this isn't always going to remain positive.

Looking at these picture we can see the stock return for 2017 and the code used to help format the cells to give us an easier worksheet to read. Looking at this shows positive returns for 2017, making it a great year to have invested in some of the stocks. 

# Execution Times

One thing I found interesting was to find out how quickly excel was able to go through tthe data and compile them for us in the return table. Although both years took roughly the same amount of time, the timing to get both years were under one second.

Hopefully when Steve and his family use it they can get it under a faster time but I still find this to be an exceptionally fast time to compile all of the data!!
# Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring
Refactoring the code was a really good thing because it allowed me to compile all of the code into one Macro and have everything work at once instead of having to go between the different Macro's. A disadvantage I can see is that if you are refactoring when looking between the multiple macros and trying to refactor them into one you can easily miss something, especially something so small like an apostrophe or value. All in all Refactoring is definitely a great thing to do as to make the code as simple and not stretched out into many differnet Macros.
